# HIST3907-dreadful-visitation

A repository for my final project in HIST3907A: Cultural History of Disease, in which I intend to visualize and analyze the contents of the famed document [*London's Dreadful Visitation*](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo2/A41826.0001.001/1:3?rgn=div1;view=toc). This document contains demographic data about London and its surrounding areas from the "final" plague year of 1665.
